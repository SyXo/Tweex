after setting up /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf with:

wpa_passphrase mynetwork mynetworkpasscode

you may have to chmod -x /etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager

then:

'/etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager stop' # Kill the networkmanager daemon.

'pkill wpa_supplicant' # Kill remaining wpa_supplicant process

'rfkill unblock 1' # Unblock wireless LAN interface at index 1 ('rfkill list' for details)

'wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlan0 -D wext' # Connect using wpa_supplicant (/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf was already in place)

'dhcpcd' # Get IP address via DHCP

'sh /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall' # Put firewall rules in place
