install lilo di VM Guest ('di' is indonesian for 'at')

run the 'simple' lilo install in the installer, which will set up a lilo.conf for you,
but it will fail, don't worry ... we'll fix it post-install

finish installation
chroot /mnt

Create initrd for generic kernel
/usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh | sh


edit /etc/lilo.conf:

lba32 # Allow booting past 1024th cylinder with a recent BIOS
compact
boot = /dev/vda
disk = /dev/vda
bios = 0x80
max-partitions = 7


image = /boot/vmlinuz
  initrd = /boot/initrd.gz
  root = /dev/vda1
  label = Linux
  read-only

exit
lilo -C /mnt/etc/lilo.conf

reboot
