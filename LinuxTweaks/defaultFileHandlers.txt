change the default for certain files (in my case, change from gedit to sublime text for files)

hop in to these two files:
/usr/share/applications/defaults.list - the system defaults list
~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list - the user's personal desktop session defaults list

change anything that is gedit (or whatever the default text editor depending on DE)
  to your pick (in my case sublime_text.desktop)
